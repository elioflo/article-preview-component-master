## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS
- BEM

### What I learned

Some things I learned doing this challenge:

- To show just a part of an image using `object-fit` and `object-position`.
- To make a bubble dialog and use `::before` for its tail.
- Use `classList`'s `toggle` method instead of `if`'s. 

### Continued development

Need to practice CSS Grid. 

### Useful resources

- [w3school](https://www.w3schools.com/) - To consult about doubts that appeared.
- [mdn_](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - MDN Web Docs has the most up-to-date and accurate information and the content is presented in an easy-to-understand manner. I also like that it's available in many languages (very important!).
